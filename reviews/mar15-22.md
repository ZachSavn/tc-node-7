# Review 3/16/22 - Git

Git is an open-source, _distributed version control system_.

## Setting Git Configs

- `git config --global user.name "Name"`
- `git config --global user.email "email@email.com"`

## Fork and clone repositories

A way to work on a copy of a project and contribute to the original source code.

- Select the _Fork_ option on GitHub
- Then copy the SSH link to clone
- In your terminal`git clone <SSH_ADDRESS.git>
- Do work
- Open a _pull request_ to contribute to the original source code

## Git Commands

- `git init` to initialize a new git repository in the current directory
  - If using a terminal based on linux/unix, use `rm -rf .git` to delete the git folder in a directory
  - If using command prompt on windows, use `del /s .git`
- `git pull` to fetch and merge the latest changes on the remote branch
- `git branch` to list local branches
  - use `-a` to list all branches local and remote
  - `-va` to view latest commit messages for each branch
- `git branch <name>` to create a new branch
- `git checkout <name>` to switch to a branch
- `git checkout -b <name>` to create and switch to a new branch in one command
- `git merge <name>` to merge a branches commits into the currently checked out branch
  - Merging branches does not delete branches
  - Use `git branch -d <name>` to delete a branch
- `git stash` will temporarily stash/keep working directory changes
- `git stash pop` will return the temporarily stashed working directory changes

### Git Workflow

- `git add` moves a file(s) to the staging area
- `git commit [-m "some descriptive message"]` creates a snapshot of the current project
  - If in Vim, use `esc + :qa` to exit
- `git push` to send the lastest local updates to the remote branch
